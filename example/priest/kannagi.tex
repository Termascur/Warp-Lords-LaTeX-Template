{Kannagi}
{WIL (Strength of Abilities) / MAG (Shikigami, Ofuda, Nine Cuts)}
{Kannagi are a blend of the Shinto priests and shrine maidens who serve the eight million gods of Japan and the occultist Onmyouji who practice a mix of philosophy, science, and taming spirits as servants.}
{Kannagi can use their Nine Cuts skill to exercise evil spirits with ease. They can erect barriers to defend against damage or to keep a certain thing out of an area. Finally, their ability to take spiritual creatures as servants with their Shikigami skill gives them a significant boost in power and versatility.}[
Barrier:
Magical barriers whose strength increases with charge time. Barriers can remain indefinitely so long as they still have charges remaining. When you use a barrier skill, you can create new barriers or recharge existing ones. Barriers shatter when their power is exhausted.
\begin{wldescription}
\item [:] You can charge barriers up to a number of actions equal to your WIL.
\item [:] You can maintain up to 1 barrier per WIL rank.
\end{wldescription}]

{Barrier: Mamori}
{7}
{Mamori means protection. Like its name implies, it creates a protective barrier. The barrier can be placed in a fixed location or centered on an object or person. When placed in a fixed location, it is immobile and acts as a physical barrier. When centered on an object or person, the barrier moves with them and protects them from harm without impeding their daily lives. A mamori barrier absorbs 1 wound per charge. It lasts indefinitely unless it takes the requisite amount of wounds or is dismissed by the caster.}
{Absorbs 1 wound per charge.}
\skilldescription
{Barrier: Misogi}
{12}
{Misogi means purification. Like its name implies, it purifies the space within the barrier.
\\When casting the barrier, specify something as impure. This can be magic, evil spirits, pollution or some other concept. This thing cannot exist inside the barrier. Any of the specified thing in the radius when you cast the barrier is forced outside the radius.
\\If the thing deemed impure tries to enter the barrier, it must roll opposed WIL against you. If it succeeds, the barrier is destroyed prematurely. If you succeed, the thing cannot enter the barrier for the duration no matter how many times it tries.
\\A Misogi barrier has a 1m radius and 1 hour duration per charge.}
{Specifies something that cannot exist within barrier.}
\skilldescription
{Barrier: Shihou}
{12}
{Shihou means four directions. This is a reference to the four sacred beasts said to guard the four cardinal directions; Seiryuu (Azure Dragon) of the east, Byakko (White Tiger) of the west, Genbu (Black Tortoise) of the north, and Suzaku (Vermillion Bird) of the south.
\\A Shihou barrier creates an impassible barrier. When you set the barrier, you can choose whether it only blocks passage for everything or only for certain things (e.g. only spirits or everything but humans). You can also choose whether it blocks passage into the barrier, out of the barrier, or both ways.
\\A Shihou barrier does not block extradimensional travel. A Shihou barrier has a radius of 3m and 1 hour duration per charge.}
