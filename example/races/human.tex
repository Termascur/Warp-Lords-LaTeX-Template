\racedescription{Human}
{Some men just want to watch the world burn.}
{Old human proverb.}
{Humans are said to originate from the African continent on the planet Earth. There is much debate over the exact origins of the human species. Humans themselves cannot come to a consensus on anything, not even whether or not humans exist.\\
Human belief is said to be so strong, they"re able to shape the world around them. If enough humans believe in something, it can become real. Other races are also thought to possess this power because humans believe everyone can do it.}
{Humans vary wildly in their appearance. Their skin can range from snow white to inky black and just about every shade in between. Their hair is typically black, brown, red, or blonde. Their eyes are typically black, brown, blue, green, or hazel. Average height for adults is roughly 160-175 cm, but they can range anywhere from 54cm to nearly 3m.\\
Humans are highly adaptable and can change to suit new environments within just a few generations. They also possess the unique ability to interbreed with closely related species and produce fertile offspring that retain the genes of their non-human parents.}
{Humans can be found in just about any habitat capable of supporting life. They will even build complex structures or change the climate to live in places that would otherwise kill them.}
{Human civilization rose and collapsed several times before they were visited by a race of extraterrestrials that supplied them with advanced technology. Humanity progressed from a Type 0 civilization into a Type II civilization on the Kardashev Scale in the span of a single generation.\\
From there, they spread out across countless star systems and engaged in war with many alien races. Among them were the Gloops, the Ungoloths, a race of killer plants called the Verdesians, and even the race that supplied them with the advanced technology that sped up their rise to power.}
{
\item Their stat bonuses combined with their 'Unshakeable Faith' racial ability make humans naturally suited for the Priest class. Humans can easily excel at any of the paths available to the Priest.
\item They're also well suited for the Socialite path of the Scholar class, as they are incredibly social animals. Except when they choose not to be.
\item The 'Recessive Genes' and 'Dilettante' racial abilities make them incredibly versatile. Humans can excel in just about any role if they try hard enough.}
