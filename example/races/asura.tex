{Asura are said to give the best hugs.}

{In Hindu mythology, there is debate over the exact nature of the asura. Some sources claim them to be a general term for all powerful beings. Others state the asura are an evil force who oppose the good devas. However, in modern times their image has come to be associated with many-armed humanoids.}
{The defining feature of asura are their multiple arms. These arms can be physical or made of spiritual energy. Most asura change their extra arms between these states at will. These arms can be as long as their normal arms, or even extend for many meters.\\
Some asura also have horns that allow them to sense the presence of living things. The horns range wildly in size and shape.\\
Asura also tend to have skin, eye, and hair colors not found in other humanoids. Their skin ranges from pearly white to pale blue to bright red. It's common for their hair to be hot pink, shining bronze, or deep purple. Their eyes come in every color of the rainbow. Asura have a higher rate of heterochromia (eyes of two different colors) than other humanoid species.}
{Asura can be found in most climates that support humanoid life.}
{In the past, asura believed themselves to be the one race worthy of ruling all of existence. This led to frequent conflicts with other races, most notably the naga.\\
Naga controlled large swaths of territory and a wealth of natural resources, and the asura wanted that power for themselves. Despite being outmatched in both numbers and resources, they were able to give the naga a run for their money. They did this by experimenting with genetics and unique weapons that enhanced an asura's natural abilities. In the end, the asura met defeat at the hands of the naga and their allies.\\
This inherent feeling of superiority has not only resulted in numerous wars, but has caused them to face discrimination thanks to their conflicts with the naga.\\
This supremacist attitude and the wars it brought caused asura to face discrimination during and after their wars with the naga.}
