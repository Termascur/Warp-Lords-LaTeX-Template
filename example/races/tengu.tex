{Tengu are creatures from Japanese mythology associated with crows. Their name literally means "heavenly dogs" and comes from a Chinese legend of more dog-like creatures. Over time though, the image of the tengu has changed.\\
Originally, they were considered evil spirits who opposed Buddhism. They were known to possess people and abduct them, sometimes dropping them in tall trees or on remote mountains.\\
Over time, their image has softened, but they are still depicted as inscrutable beings who view themselves as above other races.}
{Tengu are incredibly agile beings. They possess superhuman grace and never lose their balance. They tend to have slender builds.\\
A tengu's most prominent feature is its wings. All tengu possess wings like a crow which extend from their back. They can make their wings appear and disappear at will.\\
Tengu also are known for their prominent noses. They typically have large aquiline noses. These are somewhat less pronounced in females. Also common is a long, thin nose that can extend 15cm or more. Long-nosed tengu generally have bright red skin.\\
Male tengu tend to have a fierce appearance with bushy eyebrows and long beards. Both sexes have slightly pointed ears.}
{Tengu prefer to make their homes on tall mountains or in historically and spiritually significant places. They often build elaborate and secretive societies away from the prying eyes of other races.}
{Tengu society went through several major upheavals starting with the widespread use of gunpowder weapons. When firearms became common, tengu were split between isolationists and supremacists. Isolationists viewed firearms as a threat. A single tengu killed by firearms would damage their reputation. Supremacists viewed humans as wholly beneath them, even with their new weapons. The isolationists built societies hidden away from humans while the supremacists lived amongst them, flaunting their powers.\\
The next major revelation came when humanity spread out to other planets. Tengu built fearsome nations on floating islands on these new worlds. Humanity and the tengu fought for aerial dominance. Although they consider themselves superior, tengu are largely unconcerned with the struggles of other races.}
