\racedescription{Naga}
{The snakes were of virulent poison, great prowess and excess of strength, and ever bent on biting other creatures .}
{The Mahabharata}
{A race of serpentine deities from Indian mythology, the naga often have an antagonistic role in stories. However, they are not always on the side of evil.\\
The naga are a proud and superstitious people. Many treat snakes as sacred and have a natural distrust of eagles. This is thought to stem from the nagas of legend being enemies of the great eagle Garuda.}
{At first glance, a naga may appear to be a human. However, there are a number of telltale signs of their true nature.\\
All nagas have eyes like a snake. Depending on the individual, they may have pupils that are slitted, diamond-shaped, or horizontal. They may also be a color that doesn't naturally occur in humans such as red, gold, or a vibrant green.\\
Nagas also have fangs capable of injecting venom with a bite or spitting venom.\\
Nagas have lithe and flexible bodies. While they can have any skin color that humans have, they tend to have darker complexions.\\
Their powerful immune systems make most naga immune to poisons and diseases.\\
Naga are also capable of changing their bodies to more closely resemble snakes. The most dramatic change would be turning their legs into that of a serpent tail.\\
Due to this, some say snakes are to naga what wolves are to werewolves or bats are to vampires.}
{Naga can survive in most climates, but heavily favor warm environments.}
{Throughout history, naga have built great and wealthy empires. They tend to dominate their neighbors, either through military conquest or economic subjugation.\\
They are not a unified people, as they have been known to fight amongst themselves. The most notable source of this conflict came from a naga superstition that red hair was a sign of mental illness and an omen of all the blood that person would spill in their life. This led to a policy of exiling or executing redheaded nagas. Some of these exiled redheads built a new nation in exile and engaged in generations of bloody warfare with those that exiled them, ironically proving the superstition true.\\
Historically, the greatest rivals of the naga have been the asura. The two races have fought many wars over the same resources, each believing themselves to be the rightful rulers of the world. However, between their superior numbers and the fact that they already controlled the resources, they have almost always had the upper hand.}
{
\item Naga have a strong warrior culture. Naga will often supplement their combat skills with reiki to create unique abilities that give them an edge in combat.
\item Some use their natural resistance to poisons and diseases to become skilled alchemists.
\item Though they are superstitious, they're not particularly religious. As such, naga priests tend to follow animistic religious paths such as druid or skinwalker.}
