\section{Race Introduction}
A character’s race affects their physical appearance. In addition, the race you choose will dictate which mechanical benefits you will receive. These are listed below.
\subsection{Stat Bonuses}
All characters gain +2 to one stat, and +1 to a second stat at the start based on their race. Which stats the bonuses apply to are dictated by the race you choose to play as.
\subsection{Free Ability}
An ability or collection of abilities a character a character receives during character creation. The race you choose to play as determines which free abilities you receive.
\subsection{Racial Path}
Lists of abilities based on race that you can choose to purchase that are tied to a specific race. These function similarly to class abilities.
