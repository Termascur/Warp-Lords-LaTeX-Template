\racedescription{Sídhe}
{No one ever said elves are nice.}
{Terry Pratchett}
{Sídhe are thought to be the original inhabitants of Ireland, predating the Celtic peoples. They"re called by a number of names, but they were said to have an unearthly beauty.\\
There are many legends of similar creatures in other cultures, such as the alfr of Norse cultures. The common name for them however would be "elf."\\
Whatever their name, legends exist across the world about their fantastic power and their barbaric nature.\\
Sídhe can live for hundreds of years, giving rise to the belief that they are immortal. Many sídhe like to encourage this belief.}
{Sídhe tend to look like beautiful humans but with something uncanny about them. Though some have distinct male or female traits, it's not uncommon for sídhe to be androgynous.\\
Their most distinguishing trait would be their pointy ears. A sídhe's ears can be leaf-shaped, like a human ear with a subtle point, or they can be long and pointy.\\
Sídhe may have certain inhuman aspects about their appearance. They may have solid black eyes, unnatural hair colors, or unusual proportions.\\
Sídhe can go without sleep entirely if they so choose, simply meditating instead. Others can teleport short distances or shrink themselves down to small sizes. Their senses are far superior to those of a human. Above all, sídhe have incredibly long lifespans. They can live for centuries if nothing kills them and they're allowed to die of natural causes.}
{Sídhe prefer to surround themselves with nature. Even their most grandiose cities blend seamlessly into the natural world.}
{In the past, the sídhe raised great kingdoms that ruled many lands. However, as time went on, their numbers dwindled and their influence waned.\\
As other races overtook them, they began to suffer discrimination. This treatment wasn't universal, but it was still fairly common.\\
Although they've managed to keep power in a few small kingdoms, the sídhe have mostly merged into larger societies.}
{
\item As warriors, the sídhe tend toward the paths of the sniper and ranger.
\item As scholars, they tend toward the paths of the artisan and merchant.
\item As mages, they tend toward the paths of elemental and healing.}
