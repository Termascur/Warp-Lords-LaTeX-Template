\begin{path}
{Physicist}
{INT (Strength of Effects/ Concentration) / MAG (Skill Costs) / LUC (Random Portals)}
{All of space and time are yours to toy with. The laws of physics are your plaything. Through a deep understanding of how the universe works, you're able to bend its laws to your whims. Whether it's bending time, opening wormholes, or manipulating the electromagnetic fields around atoms, only by truly understanding something can you begin to affect change.}
{A physicist's various time and gravity skills can act as buffs and debuffs. Their ability to create portals allows their party to travel anywhere in the multiverse they need to go. Finally, the Pocket Dimension skill can create a safe haven for the party to hide in, even in the midst of an enemy stronghold.}[
Unless a time limit is specified, physicist abilities last as long as you maintain concentration.
\begin{itemize}
\item You can concentrate on a number of physicist effects per round equal to your INT rank.
\item You must spend 1 action each round to maintain concentration on all ongoing physicist effects.
\end{itemize}]
\skilldescription
{Doppelgänger}
{15}
{Subatomic particles can exist in multiple places at once. By applying these same laws of quantum mechanics on a larger scale, you're able to materialize a copy of yourself for brief periods of time.
\\Costs 2 MAG to activate. An exact copy of you appears with all of your stats and skills. The copy lasts for 1 action per INT rank. Once it uses up its allotted actions, the doppelganger disappears and you gain its experiences.
\\Your doppelganger can use any skill you possess, but it cannot summon an additional doppelgänger. If it attempts to use a skill with a charge time and it disappears before the skill is fully charged, a wild magic effect occurs.
\\If your doppelgänger is killed before the duration expires, you take WIL wounds equal to half your VIT. You suffer no negative side effects if your doppelgänger disappears on its own at the end of the duration.}
{Create a copy of yourself for up to 1 action per INT rank.}
\skilldescription
{Electromagnetic Phasing}
{8}
{You can pass through solid objects by manipulating the electromagnetic fields surrounding atoms.
\\Costs 1 wound to the stat of your choice. You can pass through solid objects as if incorporeal for 1 action.}
{Pass through solid objects for a single action.}
\skilldescription
{Gravity Decrease}
{12}
{Decrease the effects of gravity within a radius of 1m per INT rank. The amount you can decrease gravity is based on your INT rank.
\begin{wldescription}
\item [E rank:]  2x
\item [D rank:]  3x
\item [C rank:]  4x
\item [B rank:]  5x
\item [A rank:]  7x
\item [EX rank:]  10x
\end{wldescription}
The effects of this decrease are subject to GM discretion. Those in the area may be able to jump great distances, lift heavy objects, or simply stumble around like an astronaut on the moon. You must spend 1 action each round concentrating to maintain the effect.}
{Decrease gravity by an amount based on your INT rank.}
\skilldescription
{Gravity Increase}
{12}
{Increase the effects of gravity within a radius of 1m per INT rank. The amount you can increase gravity is based on your INT rank.
\begin{wldescription}
\item [E rank:]  2x
\item [D rank:]  3x
\item [C rank:]  4x
\item [B rank:]  5x
\item [A rank:]  7x
\item [EX rank:]  10x
\end{wldescription}
The effects of this increase are subject to GM discretion. Those in the area may have trouble lifting their equipment, move slowly, or get super fit from all the high-gravity strength training they're doing. You must spend 1 action each round concentrating to maintain the effect.}
{Increase gravity by an amount based on your INT rank.}
\skilldescription
{Gravity Redirect}
{12}
{You can change the directional orientation of gravity within a certain area.
\\Change the direction of gravity within a radius of 1m per INT rank. You must spend 1 action each round concentrating to maintain the effect.}
{Control the direction of gravity in small area.}
\skilldescription
{Pocket Dimension}
{15*}
{Create an extradimensional space up to 20 cubic meters per INT rank in size. You have full control of the appearance and environmental conditions inside. For example, you can make your space look like a small garden, an empty room, or just fire.
\\You can create portals to the space at will. You can bring anything or anyone to your pocket dimension and they will remain safely inside, even if you leave. You can choose to not let certain people through the portals you create. However, other beings may travel to your dimension through skills like Portal or Warp. Roll INT vs. SEN to keep your pocket dimension hidden from them.
\\You can take this skill multiple times. Each time, you can choose to create a new Pocket Dimension or add to an existing one.}
{Create an extradimensional space.}
\skilldescription
{Portals}
{13}
{A wormhole connects two distant points by folding space. Through concentration, you're able to open portals that do the same thing.
\\By spending 1 action, you can open a portal up to 1m radius per INT rank wide. You must spend 1 action each round concentrating to keep the portal open. The maximum range for the portal is based on your INT rank.
\begin{wldescription}
\item [E rank:]  Line of sight
\item [D rank:]  1,000km
\item [C rank:]  Global
\item [B rank:]  Universal
\item [A rank:]  Across dimensions
\end{wldescription}
Opening a portal to someplace you’ve never been requires a successful INT check to determine if you're able to get the coordinates right. Opening a portal to a random place requires a LUC check to determine whether you open a portal to someplace safe or someplace dangerous.}
{Open a portal to another point in space.}
\skilldescription
{Time Freeze}
{12}
{Create a bubble of frozen time within 5m per INT rank. Affects an area with a radius of 1m per INT rank.
\\Roll INT (RD) + WIL (SB) vs. WIL. Those who fail the roll within the area of effect are frozen in time, unable to move. Those who succeed are slowed, as per the Time Slow skill. Any new targets that enter the area after the effect is cast must roll against the effect. The caster can move freely within the area without suffering the time slow effects.
\\The effect lasts for exactly 1 round (roughly 30 seconds).  You can spend 1 action each round concentrating to maintain the effect. However, you must roll against those caught inside each round.}
{Create a bubble of frozen time.}
\skilldescription
{Time Rewind}
{13}
{Turn back time by a few seconds to fix your mistakes.
\\Costs 2 MAG to activate. You can rewind time by 6 seconds or undo 1 action. Gain a +15 bonus to rolls for any action being repeated. You cannot use this skill if you're killed or lose consciousness.
\\\textbf{EXAMPLE:} An enemy lands an attack on you with devastating consequences. If you use this skill, time rewinds to just before the attack landed. Using your future insight, gain a +15 bonus to the new defense roll.}
{Rewind time 1 action. +15 bonus on the new roll.}
\skilldescription
{Time Slow}
{9}
{Slow down time for a single target.
\\Roll INT vs. WIL. If you succeed, the target takes a -1 to their effective AGI rank for the duration of the effect. If this would drop their effective AGI rank below E-rank, the target can no longer explode on opposed rolls. You must spend 1 action each round concentrating to maintain the effect.}
{-1 AGI rank on a single target. Below E rank prevents dice explosions.}
\skilldescription
{Time Speed}
{9}
{Speed up time for a single target.
\\Target gains +1 effective AGI rank for the duration of the effect. You must spend 1 action each round concentrating to maintain the effect.}
{+1 AGI rank on a single target.}
\skilldescription
{Time Stop}
{13}
{Stop time to act when your enemies cannot fight back.
\\Costs 2 MAG to activate. Stop time for a number of actions equal to your INT rank. While time is stopped, you can act normally. Attacks automatically hit against helpless targets. However, any ranged attacks that are thrown or shot freeze in midair after leaving your body. Once time restarts, they fly straight for the intended target.
\\Ranged attacks must still be rolled against the target's static armor bonus. Melee attacks must also be rolled against the target's static armor bonus. However, you can spend 2 actions to carefully attack a vulnerable spot and automatically hit.}
{Stop time for a number of actions equal to your INT rank.}
